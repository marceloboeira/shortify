### Setup

Assuming that you already had Mongo and Ruby/Bundler installed, you can just run: `bundle install`

### Running

Once everything is installed, you can run: `bin/rails server`

If you use `foreman`, there is two options available:

* `foreman start -f Procfile` - Runs the default web server
* `foreman start -f Procfile.dev` - Runs the webserver as also a mongodb server

Hopefully by now the project is running
